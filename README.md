# Snake
*Proof of Concept* for a posible concurrent games platform.

It's just the basic retro Snake game but with a little tiny difference. ***To move the Snake there is a team of 4 people behind. Each person is a different direction***. One person handle the right direction, other the left, other the up and other the down one.
